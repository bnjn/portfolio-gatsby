                <p>I am a motivated full stack web developer with excellent problem-solving abilities and an eye for design. My life long passion for technology and engineering led me to complete a coding bootcamp with iO Academy; I quickly found a love for coding and was able to transfer many skills from previous experience and education. I enjoy learning and pride myself on being quick to pick up new concepts.</p>
                <p>I spend most of my spare time looking after three ferrets, mixing drum & bass and walking in the Mendips. Other interests include working on various projects with my 3D printers and playing Magic: The Gathering poorly. Going to music events is another big passion of mine as I love the experience of live music.</p>
