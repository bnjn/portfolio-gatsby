                <p>As a recent graduate of iO Academy's full-stack bootcamp and Jack of all trades, I am a comfortable working across the stack and picking up new technologies. I believe an understanding of the bigger picture makes working as a team both more efficient and enjoyable; for this reason, I am happy to call myself a full-stack developer and believe strongly in agile practices. I currently love working with the MERN stack but I also have experience with LAMP as well as picking the best combination of tech for the job. I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and passion for good design. My commitment to personal, career and academic development drives me to continuously improve myself and my knowledge.</p>
                <p>I spend most of my spare time looking after three ferrets, mixing drum & bass and walking in the Mendips. My other interests include working on various projects with my 3D printers and playing Magic: The Gathering poorly. I love going to music events of all genres as nothing beats the experience of live music.</p>
